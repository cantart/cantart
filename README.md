# Hi 👋, I'm Art

I'm a software engineer from Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭

### A little bit about me:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning How to Design Programs (HtDP) to firm up my foundation in systematic problem solving
- 🧠 I’m exploring how to model the world with **math**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **My name’s Art, but but I'm not artistic at all** 😄
- 👀 I’m passively looking for new opportunities — feel free to reach out if you think we’d be a great match!

### 🛠️ What I do:

Actually, I have an Electrical Engineering background, which shaped how I approach problems - with structure, logic, and a healthy respect for systems that work.

I've worked across a wide range of backend technologies — like Go, Python, Kafka, and Redis — but I'm more focused on using the right tool for the problem than sticking to a specific stack.

Now I'm focusing on building good, scalable systems and leveling up my design skills with a structured approach.

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
